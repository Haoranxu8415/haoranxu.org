            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a background in design with a strong passion for UI/UX. My focus lies in creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences that connect users with technology seamlessly.</p>

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to build digital experiences that feel as seamless and alive as the physical world — interfaces that breathe, adapt, and empower. I’m especially interested in how ethical design, AI, and behavioral psychology intersect to shape how we engage with technology. Long-term, I hope to study business and design at a global university, then lead or join a team creating tools that help people think, learn, and express themselves better.</p>

            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p>I value clarity, empathy, and intentionality in design. To me, every interface is a conversation — and good design speaks fluently, with purpose and respect for the user. I believe that even the smallest details — like a loading animation or button microinteraction — deserve thoughtful attention, because they shape how people feel.</p>
