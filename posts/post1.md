It started with a rabbit, a cat, a dog, and a cookie.

I didn’t expect much when I opened that pack of modeling clay. I thought it’d be fun to test my Sony A7R3 and shoot something small. But by the time I was animating the cookie slowly falling, I realized I was doing more than testing a camera — I was storytelling.

Claymation demands patience. Every frame, every shadow matters. But it also gives back magic — the kind of magic you can’t quite replicate with CGI.

My short film, **“The Last Crumb,”** might only be two minutes long. But it taught me how constraints — like gravity, imperfection, or a lopsided bunny ear — can **spark creativity**, not limit it.

That’s something I want to carry into every project I make.
