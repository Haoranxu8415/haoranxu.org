Lately, I’ve been thinking about how **algorithms shape our identity**. Not just what we like — but how we see ourselves.

Social platforms tend to amplify the parts of us that are easiest to categorize. If you pause on one cooking video, you’ll get more. Watch two, and suddenly you're a “foodie.” But what if you’re also into coding, philosophy, and street photography? Those parts get buried.

This isn’t just a tech problem. It’s a **self-perception** problem. When you’re constantly being shown a simplified version of yourself, it’s easy to start believing it.

We need more platforms that reflect complexity — not just preference. Places where contradiction is okay. Where discovery isn’t optimized, but accidental.
