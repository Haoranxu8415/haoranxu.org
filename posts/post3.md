"Why I Started Designing My Own Website"

[Design, Personal Reflection, Web Development]

I’ve always admired beautifully crafted websites — the kind where every element feels intentional. As someone interested in **UI/UX design**, I wanted to go beyond admiring and start creating.

Building **haoranxu.org** was not just a coding exercise. It was a space where I could experiment with layout, motion, and typography without constraints. No templates. No drag-and-drop editors. Just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the closest thing I could find to building a world from scratch.

I found joy in the smallest things:
- Picking the right easing curve for an animation
- Tuning the opacity of a background blur until it felt just right
- Writing my own routing logic for page transitions

This site is not just a portfolio. It’s an evolving sketchbook of everything I love about digital design.
